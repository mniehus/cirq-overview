	abstract = {We describe in this paper how the nonlinear Josephson inductance is the crucial circuit element for all Josephson qubits. We discuss the three types of qubit circuits, and show how these circuits use this nonlinearity in unique manners. We give a brief derivation of the {BCS} theory, highlighting the appearance of the macroscopic phase parameter. The Josephson equations are derived using standard first and second order perturbation theory that describe quasiparticle and Cooper-pair tunneling. An exact calculation of the Josephson effect then follows using the quasiparticle bound-state theory, and then expand upon this theory to describe quasiparticle excitations as transitions from the ground to excited bound states from nonadiabatic changes in the bias. Although quasiparticle current is typically calculated only for a constant {DC} voltage, the advantage to this approach is seen where we qualitatively describe quasiparticle tunneling with {AC} voltage excitations, as appropriate for the qubit state. This section describes how the Josephson qubit is typically insensitive to quasiparticle damping, even to the extent that a phase qubit can be constructed from microbridge junctions.},

cannot break down the atomic size barrier, the fact implies a fundamental size limit at the atomic/nucleus scale. This means, no more
simple 18-month doubling, but other forms of transistor doubling may happen at a different slope. We are particularly interested
in the nano enhancement area. (i) 3 Dimensions: If the progress in shrinking the in-plane dimensions is to slow down, vertical
integration can help increasing the areal device transistor density. As the devices continue to shrink into the 20 to 30 nm range,
the consideration of thermal properties and transport in such devices becomes increasingly important. (ii) Quantum computing:
The other types of transistor material are rapidly developed in laboratories worldwide, for example, Spintronics, Nanostorage,
{HP} display Nanotechnology, which are modifying this Law. We shall consider the limitation of phonon engineering fundamental

This article investigates the roles of quantum mechanics and computation in free will. Although quantum mechanics implies that events are intrinsically unpredictable, the ‘pure stochasticity’ of quantum mechanics adds only randomness to decision making processes, not freedom. By contrast, the theory of computation implies that even when our decisions arise from a completely deterministic decision-making process, the outcomes of that process can be intrinsically unpredictable, even to – especially to – ourselves. I argue that this intrinsic computational unpredictability of the decision making process is what give rise to our impression that we possess free will. Finally, I propose a ‘Turing test’ for free will: a decision maker who passes this test will tend to believe that he, she, or it possesses free will, whether the world is deterministic or not.},

	abstract = {This paper studies the notion of “depth” of a combinatorial optimization problem, which has already been touched on by several other authors (cf. Weber or Hajek). This notion can be defined as follows: Consider a discrete optimization problem min \{c(x{\textbar}x ∈ X\}. Usually hill climbing algorithms work as follows: First, a neighbourhood structure has to be specified on X. Then, starting from an arbitrary solution, say x0, one constructs a sequence x0,x1,x2… (hopefully leading to an optimum) such that xi is a neighbour of xi−1 for all i. For x0 ∈ X, the depth d(x0) is defined to be the smallest d ≥ 0 such that there exists a sequence x0,x1,…,xn with c(xn) {\textless} c(x0) and all intermediate solutions xi having objective value c(xi) ≤ c(x0) + d. The depth of the problem is defined to be the maximum depth of a solution x0 ∈ X. This notion plays an important role in the theory of Simulated Annealing. Here we want to show that the depth is of some interest in its own right. We will prove some upper bounds and investigate the computational complexity of the depth function for some selected examples.},

For the local optima we give a fairly comprehensive description of the properties, including the expected time to reach a local optimum, the number of local optima at different cost levels, the distance between optima, and the expected probability of reaching the optima. Principle component analysis is used to understand the correlations between the local optima. Most of the properties that we examine have not been studied previously, particularly those concerned with properties of the local optima. We compare and contrast the behavior of the four different problems. Although the problems are very different at the low level, many of the long-range properties exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity.},

Gradient descent algorithms ﬁnd local minima by moving along the direction of steepest descent while Newton’s method takes into account curvature information and thereby often improves convergence. Here, we develop quantum versions of these iterative optimization algorithms and apply them to polynomial optimization with a unit norm constraint. In each step, multiple copies of the current candidate are used to improve the candidate using quantum phase estimation, an adapted quantum principal component analysis scheme, as well as quantum matrix multiplications and inversions. The required operations perform polylogarithmically in the dimension of the solution vector, an exponential speed-up over classical algorithms, which scale polynomially. The quantum algorithm can therefore be beneﬁcial for high dimensional problems where a relatively small number of iterations is sufﬁcient.},

It is based on the diffusion-mediated recombination of excitations. For an Ising spin chain coupled to a bosonic bath, excitation diffusion in a transverse field sharply slows down as the system moves away from the quantum critical region. This leads to spatial correlations and effective freezing of the excitation density. We find that obtaining an approximate solution via the diffusion-mediated quantum annealing can be faster than via closed-system quantum annealing or Glauber dynamics.},

	abstract = {Quantum annealing ({QA}) has been proposed as a quantum enhanced optimization heuristic exploiting tunneling. Here, we demonstrate how finite range tunneling can provide considerable computational advantage. For a crafted problem designed to have tall and narrow energy barriers separating local minima, the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer achieves significant runtime advantages relative to Simulated Annealing ({SA}). For instances with 945 variables, this results in a time-to-99\%-success-probability that is \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}8\$ times faster than {SA} running on a single processor core. We also compared physical {QA} with Quantum Monte Carlo ({QMC}), an algorithm that emulates quantum tunneling on classical processors. We observe a substantial constant overhead against physical {QA}: D-Wave 2X again runs up to \${\textbackslash}sim 10{\textasciicircum}8\$ times faster than an optimized implementation of {QMC} on a single core. We note that there exist heuristic classical algorithms that can solve most instances of Chimera structured problems in a timescale comparable to the D-Wave 2X. However, we believe that such solvers will become ineffective for the next generation of annealers currently being designed. To investigate whether finite range tunneling will also confer an advantage for problems of practical interest, we conduct numerical studies on binary optimization problems that cannot yet be represented on quantum hardware. For random instances of the number partitioning problem, we find numerically that {QMC}, as well as other algorithms designed to simulate {QA}, scale better than {SA}. We discuss the implications of these findings for the design of next generation quantum annealers.},

However, it is unclear if the current state of quantum computing already provides a quantum advantage over the current state of the art in classical computing. This article assesses the performance of the D-Wave 2X quantum annealer on two {NP} hard graph problems, in particular clique finding and graph partitioning. For this, we provide formulations as Qubo and Ising Hamiltonians suitable for the quantum annealer and compare a variety of quantum solvers (Sapi, {QBSolv}, {QSage} provided by D-Wave Sys, Inc.) to current classical algorithms ({METIS}, Simulated Annealing, third-party clique finding and graph splitting heuristics) on certain test sets of graphs. We demonstrate that for small graph instances, classical methods still outperform the quantum annealer in terms of computing time, even though the quality of the best solutions obtained is comparable. Nevertheless, due to the limited problem size which can be embedded on the D-Wave 2X chip, the aforementioned finding applies to most of problems of general nature solvable on the quantum annealer. For instances specifically designed to fit the D-Wave 2X architecture, we observe substantial speed-ups in computing time over classical approaches.},

A desire to overcome this challenge has sparked a new industry of quantum technologies with the promise that engineered quantum systems can address these hard problems. A key step towards demonstrating such a system will be performing a computation beyond the capabilities of any classical computer, achieving so-called quantum supremacy. Here, using 9 superconducting qubits, we demonstrate an immediate path towards quantum supremacy. By individually tuning the qubit parameters, we are able to generate thousands of unique Hamiltonian evolutions and probe the output probabilities. The measured probabilities obey a universal distribution, consistent with uniformly sampling the full Hilbert-space. As the number of qubits in the algorithm is varied, the system continues to explore the exponentially growing number of states. Combining these large datasets with techniques from machine learning allows us to construct a model which accurately predicts the measured probabilities. We demonstrate an application of these algorithms by systematically increasing the disorder and observing a transition from delocalized states to localized states. By extending these results to a system of 50 qubits, we hope to address scientific questions that are beyond the capabilities of any classical computer.},

If p is ﬁxed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of eﬃcient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a diﬀerent strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to {MaxCut} on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for ﬁxed p.

	abstract = {Several researchers, including Leonid Levin, Gerard ’t Hooft, and Stephen Wolfram, have argued that quantum mechanics will break down before the factoring of large numbers becomes possible. If this is true, then there should be a natural set of quantum states that can account for all quantum computing experiments performed to date, but not for Shor’s factoring algorithm. We investigate as a candidate the set of states expressible by a polynomial number of additions and tensor products. Using a recent lower bound on multilinear formula size due to Raz, we then show that states arising in quantum error-correction require {nΩ}(log n) additions and tensor products even to approximate, which incidentally yields the ﬁrst superpolynomial gap between general and multilinear formula size of functions. More broadly, we introduce a complexity classiﬁcation of pure quantum states, and prove many basic facts about this classiﬁcation. Our goal is to reﬁne vague ideas about a breakdown of quantum mechanics into speciﬁc hypotheses that might be experimentally testable in the near future.},

The timeline discretization points serve as virtual neurons.

In this paper we explore some theoretical foundations of this link and show how it opens up a new avenue for the design of quantum machine learning algorithms. We interpret the process of encoding inputs in a quantum state as a nonlinear feature map that maps data to quantum Hilbert space. A quantum computer can now analyse the input data in this feature space. Based on this link, we discuss two approaches for building a quantum model for classification. In the first approach, the quantum device estimates inner products of quantum states to compute a classically intractable kernel. This kernel can be fed into any classical kernel method such as a support vector machine. In the second approach, we can use a variational quantum circuit as a linear model that classifies data explicitly in Hilbert space. We illustrate these ideas with a feature map based on squeezing in a continuous-variable system, and visualise the working principle with \$2\$-dimensional mini-benchmark datasets.},

	abstract = {The quantum Fourier transform ({QFT}), a quantum analog of the classical Fourier transform, has been shown to be a powerful tool in developing quantum algorithms. However, in classical computing there is another class of unitary transforms, the wavelet transforms, which are every bit as useful as the Fourier transform. Wavelet transforms are used to expose the multi-scale structure of a signal and are likely to be useful for quantum image processing and quantum data compression. In this paper, we derive eﬃcient, complete, quantum circuits for two representative quantum wavelet transforms, the quantum Haar and quantum Daubechies D(4) transforms. Our approach is to factor the classical operators for these transforms into direct sums, direct products and dot products of unitary matrices. In so doing, we ﬁnd that permutation matrices, a particular class of unitary matrices, play a pivotal role. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that operations that are easy and inexpensive to implement classically are not always easy and inexpensive to implement quantum mechanically, and vice versa. In particular, the computational cost of performing certain permutation matrices is ignored classically because they can be avoided explicitly. However, quantum mechanically, these permutation operations must be performed explicitly and hence their cost enters into the full complexity measure of the quantum transform. We consider the particular set of permutation matrices arising in quantum wavelet transforms and develop eﬃcient quantum circuits that implement them. This allows us to design eﬃcient, complete quantum circuits for the quantum wavelet transform.},

	abstract = {We introduce a solid harmonic wavelet scattering representation, invariant to rigid motion and stable to deformations, for regression and classiﬁcation of 2D and 3D signals. Solid harmonic wavelets are computed by multiplying solid harmonic functions with Gaussian windows dilated at different scales. Invariant scattering coefﬁcients are obtained by cascading such wavelet transforms with the complex modulus nonlinearity. We study an application of solid harmonic scattering invariants to the estimation of quantum molecular energies, which are also invariant to rigid motion and stable with respect to deformations. A multilinear regression over scattering invariants provides close to state of the art results over small and large databases of organic molecules.},

	abstract = {Considering recent advancements and successes in the development of eﬃcient quantum algorithms for electronic structure calculations — alongside similarly impressive results using machine learning techniques for computation — hybridizing quantum computing with machine learning for the intent of perform electronic structure calculations is a natural progression. Here we present a hybrid quantum algorithm employing a quantum restricted Boltzmann machine to obtain accurate molecular potential energy surfaces. The Boltzmann machine trains parameters within an Ising-type model which exists in thermal equilibrium. By exploiting a quantum algorithm to optimize the underlying objective function, we obtained an eﬃcient procedure for the calculation of the electronic ground state energy for a system. Our approach achieves high accuracy for the ground state energy of a simple diatomic molecular system such as H2, {LiH}, H2O at a speciﬁc location on its potential energy surface. With the future availability of larger-scale quantum computers and the possible training of some machine units with the simple dimensional scaling results for electronic structure, quantum machine learning techniques are set to become powerful tools to obtain accurate values for ground state energies and electronic structure for molecular systems.},

Quantum simulation of fermionic systems presents a specific challenge. The Jordan-Wigner transformation allows for representation of a fermionic operator by O(n) qubit operations. Here we develop an alternative method of simulating fermions with qubits, first proposed by Bravyi and Kitaev [S. B. Bravyi, A.Yu. Kitaev, Annals of Physics 298, 210-226 (2002)], that reduces the simulation cost to O(log n) qubit operations for one fermionic operation. We apply this new Bravyi-Kitaev transformation to the task of simulating quantum chemical Hamiltonians, and give a detailed example for the simplest possible case of molecular hydrogen in a minimal basis. We show that the quantum circuit for simulating a single Trotter time-step of the Bravyi-Kitaev derived Hamiltonian for H2 requires fewer gate applications than the equivalent circuit derived from the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Since the scaling of the Bravyi-Kitaev method is asymptotically better than the Jordan-Wigner method, this result for molecular hydrogen in a minimal basis demonstrates the superior efficiency of the Bravyi-Kitaev method for all quantum computations of electronic structure.},

Furthermore, it is able to reproduce accurately the spectrum of the hydrogen atom and its realm, relativistic quantum mechanics, is considered as the natural transition to quantum field theory. However, the Dirac equation also predicts some peculiar effects such as Klein's paradox and Zitterbewegung, an unexpected quivering motion of a free relativistic quantum particle first examined by Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger. These and other predictions would be difficult to observe in real particles, while constituting key fundamental examples to understand relativistic quantum effects. Recent years have seen an increased interest in simulations of relativistic quantum effects in different physical setups, where parameter tunability allows accessibility to different physical regimes. Here, we perform a proof-of-principle quantum simulation of the one-dimensional Dirac equation using a single trapped ion, which is set to behave as a free relativistic quantum particle. We measure as a function of time the particle position and study Zitterbewegung for different initial superpositions of positive and negative energy spinor states, as well as the cross-over from relativistic to nonrelativistic dynamics. The high level of control of trapped-ion experimental parameters makes it possible to simulate elegant textbook examples of relativistic quantum physics.},

	abstract = {We discuss encodings of fermionic many-body systems by qubits in the presence of symmetries. Such encodings eliminate redundant degrees of freedom in a way that preserves a simple structure of the system Hamiltonian enabling quantum simulations with fewer qubits. First we consider \$U(1)\$ symmetry describing the particle number conservation. Using a previously known encoding based on the first quantization method a system of \$M\$ fermi modes with \$N\$ particles can be simulated on a quantum computer with \$Q=N{\textbackslash}log\{(M)\}\$ qubits. We propose a new version of this encoding tailored to variational quantum algorithms. Also we show how to improve sparsity of the simulator Hamiltonian using orthogonal arrays. Next we consider encodings based on the second quantization method. It is shown that encodings with a given filling fraction \${\textbackslash}nu=N/M\$ and a qubit-per-mode ratio \${\textbackslash}eta=Q/M{\textless}1\$ can be constructed from efficiently decodable classical {LDPC} codes with the relative distance \$2{\textbackslash}nu\$ and the encoding rate \$1-{\textbackslash}eta\$. A family of codes based on high-girth bipartite graphs is discussed. Graph-based encodings eliminate roughly \$M/N\$ qubits. Finally we consider discrete symmetries, and show how to eliminate qubits using previously known encodings, illustrating the technique for simple molecular-type Hamiltonians.},

We improve an existing algorithm to prepare an arbitrary Slater determinant by exploiting a unitary symmetry. We also present a quantum algorithm to prepare an arbitrary fermionic Gaussian state with \$O(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$ gates and \$O(N)\$ circuit depth. Both algorithms are optimal in the sense that the numbers of parameters in the quantum circuits are equal to those to describe the quantum states. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm to implement the 2-dimensional (2D) fermionic Fourier transformation on a 2D qubit array with only \$O(N{\textasciicircum}\{1.5\})\$ gates and \$O({\textbackslash}sqrt N)\$ circuit depth, which is the minimum depth required for quantum information to travel across the qubit array.

	abstract = {The fundamental problem faced in quantum chemistry is the calculation of molecular properties, which are of practical importance in fields ranging from materials science to biochemistry. Within chemical precision, the total energy of a molecule as well as most other properties, can be calculated by solving the Schrodinger equation. However, the computational resources required to obtain exact solutions on a conventional computer generally increase exponentially with the number of atoms involved. This renders such calculations intractable for all but the smallest of systems. Recently, an efficient algorithm has been proposed enabling a quantum computer to overcome this problem by achieving only a polynomial resource scaling with system size. Such a tool would therefore provide an extremely powerful tool for new science and technology. Here we present a photonic implementation for the smallest problem: obtaining the energies of H2, the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis. We perform a key algorithmic step - the iterative phase estimation algorithm - in full, achieving a high level of precision and robustness to error. We implement other algorithmic steps with assistance from a classical computer and explain how this non-scalable approach could be avoided. Finally, we provide new theoretical results which lay the foundations for the next generation of simulation experiments using quantum computers.

	abstract = {Energy-time uncertainty plays an important role in quantum foundations and technologies, and it was even discussed by the founders of quantum mechanics. However, standard approaches (e.g., Robertson's uncertainty relation) do not apply to energy-time uncertainty because, in general, there is no Hermitian operator associated with time. Following previous approaches, we quantify time uncertainty by how well one can read off the time from a quantum clock. We then use entropy to quantify the information-theoretic distinguishability of the various time states of the clock. Our main result is an entropic energy-time uncertainty relation for general time-independent Hamiltonians, stated for both the discrete-time and continuous-time cases. Our uncertainty relation is strong, in the sense that it allows for a quantum memory to help reduce the uncertainty, and this formulation leads us to reinterpret it as a bound on the relative entropy of asymmetry. Due to the operational relevance of entropy, we anticipate that our uncertainty relation will have information-processing applications.},

	abstract = {Quantum simulation of the electronic structure problem is one of the most researched applications of quantum computing. The majority of quantum algorithms for this problem encode the wavefunction using \$N\$ Gaussian orbitals, leading to Hamiltonians with \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(N{\textasciicircum}4)\$ second-quantized terms. We avoid this overhead and extend methods to the condensed phase by utilizing a dual form of the plane wave basis which diagonalizes the potential operator, leading to a Hamiltonian representation with \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(N{\textasciicircum}2)\$ second-quantized terms. Using this representation we can implement single Trotter steps of the Hamiltonians with linear gate depth on a planar lattice. Properties of the basis allow us to deploy Trotter and Taylor series based simulations with respective circuit depths of \$\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(N{\textasciicircum}\{7/2\})\$ and \${\textbackslash}widetilde\{{\textbackslash}cal O\}(N{\textasciicircum}\{8/3\})\$ for fixed charge densities - both are large asymptotic improvements over all prior results. Variational algorithms also require significantly fewer measurements to find the mean energy in this basis, ameliorating a primary challenge of that approach. We conclude with a proposal to simulate the uniform electron gas (jellium) using a low depth variational ansatz realizable on near-term quantum devices. From these results we identify simulations of low density jellium as a promising first setting to explore quantum supremacy in electronic structure.},

	abstract = {Farhi et al. recently proposed a class of quantum algorithms, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm ({QAOA}), for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. A level-p {QAOA} circuit consists of p steps; in each step a classical Hamiltonian, derived from the cost function, is applied followed by a mixing Hamiltonian. The 2p times for which these two Hamiltonians are applied are the parameters of the algorithm, which are to be optimized classically for the best performance. As p increases, parameter optimization becomes inefficient due to the curse of dimensionality. The success of the {QAOA} approach will depend, in part, on finding effective parameter-setting strategies. Here, we analytically and numerically study parameter setting for {QAOA} applied to {MaxCut}. For level-1 {QAOA}, we derive an analytical expression for a general graph. In principle, expressions for higher p could be derived, but the number of terms quickly becomes prohibitive. For a special case of {MaxCut}, the ring of disagrees, or the 1D antiferromagnetic ring, we provide an analysis for arbitrarily high level. Using a fermionic representation, the evolution of the system under {QAOA} translates into quantum control of an ensemble of independent spins. This treatment enables us to obtain analytical expressions for the performance of {QAOA} for any p. It also greatly simplifies numerical search for the optimal values of the parameters. By exploring symmetries, we identify a lower-dimensional sub-manifold of interest; the search effort can be accordingly reduced. This analysis also explains an observed symmetry in the optimal parameter values. Further, we numerically investigate the parameter landscape and show that it is a simple one in the sense of having no local optima.},

	abstract = {The famous Travelling Salesman Problem ({TSP}) is an important category of optimization problems that is mostly encountered in various areas of science and engineering. Studying optimization problems motivates to develop advanced techniques more suited to contemporary practical problems. Among those, especially the {NP} hard problems provide an apt platform to demonstrate supremacy of quantum over classical technologies in terms of resources and time. {TSP} is one such {NP} hard problem in combinatorial optimization which takes exponential time order for solving by brute force method. Here we propose a quantum algorithm to solve the travelling salesman problem using phase estimation technique. We approach the problem by encoding the given distances between the cities as phases. We construct unitary operators whose eigenvectors are the computational basis states and eigenvalues are various combinations of these phases. Then we apply phase estimation algorithm to certain eigenstates which give us all the total distances possible for all the routes. After obtaining the distances we can search through this information using the quantum search algorithm for finding the minimum to find the least possible distance as well the route taken. This provides us a quadratic speedup over the classical brute force method for a large number of cities. In this paper, we illustrate an example of the travelling salesman problem by taking four cities and present the results by simulating the codes in the {IBM}'s quantum simulator.},

In this system, the initialisation, readout, single- and two-qubit gates have been demonstrated in various qubit representations.

Lett. 89, 199902 (2002)], the Trotterization technique is a very useful tool for universal quantum computing, and in particular, the adiabatic quantum simulation of quantum systems. Given a boson Hamiltonian involving arbitrary bilinear interactions, we propose a static version of this technique to perform an optical simulation that would enable the identification of the ground state of the Hamiltonian. By this method, the dynamical process of the adiabatic evolution is mapped to a static linear optical array which avoids the errors caused by dynamical fluctuations. We examine the cost of the physical implementation of the Trotterization, i.e. the number of discrete steps required for a given accuracy. Two conclusions are drawn. One is that number of required steps grows much more slowly than system size if the number of the non-zero matrix elements of Hamiltonian is not too large. The second is that the fluctuation of the parameters of optical elements does not affect the first conclusion. This implies that the method is robust against errors.},

The time complexities of our algorithms are nearly of order \${\textbackslash}kappa{\textasciicircum}2\$ and \${\textbackslash}kappa\$, respectively, and linear in \$1/{\textbackslash}epsilon\$, where \${\textbackslash}kappa\$ is the condition number of \$A\$ and \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$ is the precision. Both algorithms are constructed using families of Hamiltonians that are linear combinations of products of \$A\$, the projector onto the initial state \${\textbackslash}vert b {\textbackslash}rangle\$, and single-qubit Pauli operators. The first algorithm aims at preparing the ground states of the Hamiltonians while the second algorithm aims at preparing excited states. The algorithms are simple: they are not obtained using equivalences between the gate model and adiabatic quantum computing, they do not use phase estimation, and they do not use variable-time amplitude amplification. We provide numerical simulations and use methods for Hamiltonian simulation to show the optimality of our second algorithm in terms of \${\textbackslash}kappa\$. Like previous solutions of this problem, our techniques yield an exponential quantum speedup under some assumptions on \$A\$ and \${\textbackslash}vert b {\textbackslash}rangle\$.

	abstract = {Factoring large integers using a quantum computer is an outstanding research problem that can illustrate true quantum advantage over classical computers. Exponential time order is required in order to find the prime factors of an integer by means of classical computation. However, the order can be drastically reduced by converting the factorization problem to an optimization one and solving it using a quantum computer. Recent works involving both theoretical and experimental approaches use Shor's algorithm, adiabatic quantum computation and quantum annealing principles to factorize integers. However, our work makes use of the generalized Grover's algorithm as proposed by Liu, with an optimal version of classical algorithm/analytic algebra. We utilize the phase-matching property of the above algorithm for only amplitude amplification purposes to avoid an inherent phase factor that prevents perfect implementation of the algorithm. Here we experimentally demonstrate the factorization of two bi-primes, \$4088459\$ and \$966887\$ using {IBM}'s \$5\$- and \$16\$-qubit quantum processors, hence making those the largest numbers that has been factorized on a quantum device. Using the above \$5\$-qubit processor, we also realize the factorization of a tri-prime integer \$175\$, which had not been achieved to date. We observe good agreement between experimental and theoretical results with high fidelities. The difficulty of the factorization experiments has been analyzed and it has been concluded that the solution to this problem depends on the level of simplification chosen, not the size of the number factored. In principle, our results can be extended to factorize any multi-prime integer with minimum quantum resources.},

In this thesis, we show that adopting a unified and general language for process theories advances foundations and practical applications of quantum information. Our first set of results analyze quantum algorithms with a process theoretic structure. We contribute new constructions of the Fourier transform and Pontryagin duality in dagger symmetric monoidal categories. We then use this setting to study generalized unitary oracles and give a new quantum blackbox algorithm for the identification of group homomorphisms, solving the {GROUPHOMID} problem. In the remaining section, we construct a novel model of quantum blackbox algorithms in non-deterministic classical computation. Our second set of results concerns quantum foundations. We complete work begun by Coecke et al., definitively connecting the Mermin non-locality of a process theory with a simple algebraic condition on that theory's phase groups. This result allows us to offer new experimental tests for Mermin non-locality and new protocols for quantum secret sharing. In our final chapter, we exploit the shared process theoretic structure of quantum information and distributional compositional linguistics. We propose a quantum algorithm adapted from Weibe et al. to classify sentences by meaning. The clarity of the process theoretic setting allows us to recover a speedup that is lost in the naive application of the algorithm.

	abstract = {In the past years, quantum computers more and more have evolved from an academic idea to an upcoming reality. {IBM}'s project {IBM} Q can be seen as evidence of this progress. Launched in March 2017 with the goal to provide access to quantum computers for a broad audience, this allowed users to conduct quantum experiments on a 5-qubit and, since June 2017, also on a 16-qubit quantum computer (called {IBM} {QX}2 and {IBM} {QX}3, respectively). Revised versions of these 5-qubit and 16-qubit quantum computers (named {IBM} {QX}4 and {IBM} {QX}5, respectively) are available since September 2017. In order to use these, the desired quantum functionality (e.g. provided in terms of a quantum circuit) has to be properly mapped so that the underlying physical constraints are satisfied - a complex task. This demands solutions to automatically and efficiently conduct this mapping process. In this paper, we propose a methodology which addresses this problem, i.e. maps the given quantum functionality to a realization which satisfies all constraints given by the architecture and, at the same time, keeps the overhead in terms of additionally required quantum gates minimal. The proposed methodology is generic, can easily be configured for similar future architectures, and is fully integrated into {IBM}'s {SDK}. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach clearly outperforms {IBM}'s own mapping solution. In fact, for many quantum circuits, the proposed approach determines a mapping to the {IBM} architecture within minutes, while {IBM}'s solution suffers from long runtimes and runs into a timeout of 1 hour in several cases. As an additional benefit, the proposed approach yields mapped circuits with smaller costs (i.e. fewer additional gates are required). All implementations of the proposed methodology is publicly available at http://iic.jku.at/eda/research/ibm\_qx\_mapping.},

Performing nontrivial tasks in such a framework requires a fundamentally different approach than what would be used on an error-corrected quantum computer. One such approach is to use hybrid algorithms, where problems are reduced to a parameterized quantum circuit that is often optimized in a classical feedback loop. Here we described one such hybrid algorithm for machine learning tasks by building upon the classical algorithm known as random kitchen sinks. Our technique, called quantum kitchen sinks, uses quantum circuits to nonlinearly transform classical inputs into features that can then be used in a number of machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of this proposal by using it to solve binary classification problems for synthetic datasets as well as handwritten digits from the {MNIST} database. We can show, in particular, that small quantum circuits provide significant performance lift over standard linear classical algorithms, reducing classification error rates from \$50{\textbackslash}\%\$ to \${\textless}0.1{\textbackslash}\%\$, and from \$4.1{\textbackslash}\%\$ to \$1.4{\textbackslash}\%\$ in these two examples, respectively.},

	abstract = {Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies each with the potential for altering how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous for pattern recognition, with support vector machines ({SVMs}) being the most well-known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the feature space of a classification problem by a quantum state, taking advantage of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set in direct analogy to conventional {SVMs}.

	abstract = {Noisy intermediate-scale quantum ({NISQ}) computers have significant decoherence, limiting the depth of circuits that can be implemented on them. A strategy for {NISQ} algorithms is to reduce the circuit depth at the expense of increasing the qubit count. Here, we exploit this trade-off for an application called entanglement spectroscopy, where one computes the entanglement of a state \${\textbar} {\textbackslash}psi {\textbackslash}rangle\$ on systems \${AB}\$ by evaluating the R{\textbackslash}'enyi entropy of the reduced state \${\textbackslash}rho\_A = \{{\textbackslash}rm Tr\}\_B({\textbar} {\textbackslash}psi {\textbackslash}rangle {\textbackslash}langle {\textbackslash}psi {\textbar})\$. For a \$k\$-qubit state \${\textbackslash}rho(k)\$, the R{\textbackslash}'enyi entropy of order \$n\$ is computed via \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Tr\}({\textbackslash}rho(k){\textasciicircum}\{n\})\$, with the complexity growing exponentially in \$k\$ for classical computers. Johri, Steiger, and Troyer [{PRB} 96, 195136 (2017)] introduced a quantum algorithm that requires \$n\$ copies of \${\textbar} {\textbackslash}psi {\textbackslash}rangle\$ and whose depth scales linearly in \$k*n\$. Here, we present a quantum algorithm requiring twice the qubit resources (\$2n\$ copies of \${\textbar} {\textbackslash}psi {\textbackslash}rangle\$) but with a depth that is independent of both \$k\$ and \$n\$. Surprisingly this depth is only two gates. Our numerical simulations show that this short depth leads to an increased robustness to decoherence.},

	abstract = {We report on the usefulness of using neural networks as a variational state ansatz for many-body quantum systems in the context of quantum information-processing tasks. In the neural network state ansatz, the complex amplitude function of a quantum state is computed by a neural network. The resulting multipartite entanglement structure captured by this ansatz has proven rich enough to describe the ground states and unitary dynamics of various physical systems of interest. In the present paper, we supply further evidence for the usefulness of neural network states to describe multipartite entanglement. We demonstrate that neural network states are capable of efficiently representing quantum codes for quantum information transmission and quantum error correction. In particular, we show that a) neural network states yield quantum codes with a high coherent information for two important quantum channels, the depolarizing channel and the dephrasure channel; b) neural network states can be used to represent absolutely maximally entangled states, a special type of quantum error correction codes. In both cases, the neural network state ansatz provides an efficient and versatile means as variational parametrization of these states.},

We introduce a method which employs the quantum approximate optimization algorithm as a subroutine in order to approximately sample from Gibbs states of Ising Hamiltonians.

The N-Queens Problem is a notable example that falls under the class of {NP}-complete problems. It involves the arrangement of N chess queens on an N x N chessboard such that no queen attacks any other queen, i.e. no two queens are placed along the same row, column or diagonal. The best time complexity that a classical computer has achieved so far in generating all solutions of the N-Queens Problem is of the order O(N!). In this paper, we propose a new algorithm to generate all solutions to the N-Queens Problem for a given N in polynomial time of order O(N{\textasciicircum}3) and polynomial memory of order O(N{\textasciicircum}2) on a quantum computer. We simulate the 4-queens problem and demonstrate its application to satellite communication using {IBM} Quantum Experience platform.},

The goal of the workshop was to summarize recent progress in research at the interface of quantum information science and chemistry as well as to discuss the promising research challenges and opportunities in the field. Furthermore, the workshop hoped to identify target areas where cross fertilization among these fields would result in the largest payoff for developments in theory, algorithms, and experimental techniques. The ideas can be broadly categorized in two distinct areas of research that obviously have interactions and are not separated cleanly. The first area is quantum information for chemistry, or how quantum information tools, both experimental and theoretical can aid in our understanding of a wide range of problems pertaining to chemistry. The second area is chemistry for quantum information, which aims to discuss the several aspects where research in the chemical sciences can aid progress in quantum information science and technology.

We apply our method to a ubiquitous primitive: computing the overlap \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Tr\}({\textbackslash}rho{\textbackslash}sigma)\$ between two quantum states \${\textbackslash}rho\$ and \${\textbackslash}sigma\$. The standard algorithm for this task, known as the Swap Test, is used in many applications such as quantum support vector machines, and, when specialized to \${\textbackslash}rho = {\textbackslash}sigma\$, quantifies the Renyi entanglement. Here, we find algorithms that have shorter depths than the Swap Test, including one that has constant depth (independent of problem size). Furthermore, we apply our approach to the hardware-specific connectivity and gate alphabets used by Rigetti's and {IBM}'s quantum computers and demonstrate that the shorter algorithms that we derive significantly reduce the error - compared to the Swap Test - on these computers.},

We propose two core heuristics which leverage Baqprop for quantum-enhanced optimization of network parameters: Quantum Dynamical Descent ({QDD}) and Momentum Measurement Gradient Descent ({MoMGrad}). {QDD} uses simulated quantum coherent dynamics for parameter optimization, allowing for quantum tunneling through the hypothesis space landscape. {MoMGrad} leverages Baqprop to estimate gradients and thereby perform gradient descent on the parameter landscape; it can be thought of as the quantum-classical analogue of {QDD}. In addition to these core optimization strategies, we propose various methods for parallelization, regularization, and meta-learning as augmentations to {MoMGrad} and {QDD}. We introduce several quantum-coherent adaptations of canonical classical feedforward neural networks, and study how Baqprop can be used to optimize such networks. We develop multiple applications of parametric circuit learning for quantum data, and show how to perform Baqprop in each case. One such application allows for the training of hybrid quantum-classical neural-circuit networks, via the seamless integration of Baqprop with classical backpropagation. Finally, for a representative subset of these proposed applications, we demonstrate the training of these networks via numerical simulations of implementations of {QDD} and {MoMGrad}.},

	abstract = {Quantum algorithms to solve practical problems in quantum chemistry, materials science, and matrix inversion often involve a significant amount of arithmetic operations which act on a superposition of inputs. These have to be compiled to a set of fault-tolerant low-level operations and throughout this translation process, the compiler aims to come close to the Pareto-optimal front between the number of required qubits and the depth of the resulting circuit. In this paper, we provide quantum circuits for floating-point addition and multiplication which we find using two vastly different approaches. The first approach is to automatically generate circuits from classical Verilog implementations using synthesis tools and the second is to generate and optimize these circuits by hand. We compare our two approaches and provide evidence that floating-point arithmetic is a viable candidate for use in quantum computing, at least for typical scientific applications, where addition operations usually do not dominate the computation. All our circuits were constructed and tested using the software tools {LIQ}\$Ui{\textbar}{\textbackslash}rangle\{\}\$ and {RevKit}.},

Using the Hubbard model as a prototypical example, we here show all the steps necessary to determine its phase diagram and ground state properties on a quantum computer. In particular, we discuss strategies for efficiently determining and preparing the ground state of the Hubbard model starting from various mean-field states with broken symmetry. We present an efficient procedure to prepare arbitrary Slater determinants as initial states and present the complete set of quantum circuits needed to evolve from these to the ground state of the Hubbard model. We show that, using efficient nesting of the various terms each time step in the evolution can be performed with just \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(N)\$ gates and \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}({\textbackslash}log N)\$ circuit depth. We give explicit circuits to measure arbitrary local observables and static and dynamic correlation functions, both in the time and frequency domain.

In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through relaxation of exponential splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.},

	abstract = {Current approaches to fault-tolerant quantum computation will not enable useful quantum computation on near-term devices of 50 to 100 qubits. Leading proposals, such as the color code and surface code schemes, must devote a large fraction of their physical quantum bits to quantum error correction. Building from recent quantum machine learning techniques, we propose an alternative approach to quantum error correction aimed at reducing this overhead, which can be implemented in existing quantum hardware and on a myriad of quantum computing architectures. This method aims to optimize the average fidelity of encoding and recovery circuits with respect to the actual noise in the device, as opposed to that of an artificial or approximate noise model. The quantum variational error corrector ({QVECTOR}) algorithm employs a quantum circuit with parameters that are variationally-optimized according to processed data originating from quantum sampling of the device, so as to learn encoding and error-recovery gate sequences. We develop this approach for the task of preserving quantum memory and analyze its performance with simulations. We find that, subject to phase damping noise, the simulated {QVECTOR} algorithm learns a three-qubit encoding and recovery which extend the effective T2 of a quantum memory six-fold. Subject to a continuous-time amplitude- plus phase-damping noise model on five qubits, the simulated {QVECTOR} algorithm learns encoding and decoding circuits which exploit the coherence among Pauli errors in the noise model to outperform the five-qubit stabilizer code and any other scheme that does not leverage such coherence. Both of these schemes can be implemented with existing hardware.},

Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning.

We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits.

The algorithms were tested under the same conditions and ranked under several criteria, including their ability to find near-global solutions for nonconvex problems, improve a given starting point, and refine a near-optimal solution. A total of 112,448 problem instances were solved. We find that the ability of all these solvers to obtain good solutions diminishes with increasing problem size. For the problems used in this study, {TOMLAB}/{MULTIMIN}, {TOMLAB}/{GLCCLUSTER}, {MCS} and {TOMLAB}/{LGO} are better, on average, than other derivative-free solvers in terms of solution quality within 2,500 function evaluations. These global solvers outperform local solvers even for convex problems. Finally, {TOMLAB}/{OQNLP}, {NEWUOA}, and {TOMLAB}/{MULTIMIN} show superior performance in terms of refining a near-optimal solution.},

	abstract = {Compiling quantum algorithms for near-term quantum computers (accounting for connectivity and native gate alphabets) is a major challenge that has received significant attention both by industry and academia. Avoiding the exponential overhead of classical simulation of quantum dynamics will allow compilation of larger algorithms, and a strategy for this is to evaluate an algorithm's cost on a quantum computer. Here we propose to use the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product between a target unitary \$U\$ and a trainable unitary \$V\$ as the cost function to be evaluated on the quantum computer. We introduce two circuits for evaluating this cost. One circuit avoids using controlled unitaries (and hence is shorter depth) and gives \${\textbar} \{{\textbackslash}rm Tr\} (V{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}dagger U){\textbar}\$. We use this circuit for gradient-free compiling. Our other circuit gives \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Tr\}(V{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}dagger U)\$ and is a generalization of the power-of-one-qubit circuit that we call the power-of-two-qubits. We use this circuit for gradient-based compiling. We illustrate both our gradient-free and gradient-based methods by compiling various one-qubit gates to the native gate alphabets on {IBM}'s and Rigetti's quantum computers, and we also compile multiqubit gates on a simulator.},

We then describe a more efficient method that stores only the \$2{\textasciicircum}n\$ amplitudes of the \$n\$ qubit state vector \${\textbar}{\textbackslash}psi{\textbackslash}rangle\$ and optimize its single node performance. In our multi-node implementation, we use a single amplitude communication protocol that maximizes the number of qubits able to be simulated and minimizes the ratio of qubits that require communication to those that do not, and we present an algorithm for efficiently determining communication pairs among processors. We simulate up to 30 qubits on a single node and 33 qubits with the state vector partitioned across 64 nodes. Lastly, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of our communication scheme, propose potential improvements, and describe other optimizations such as storing the state vector non-sequentially in memory to map communication requirements to idle qubits in the circuit.},

	abstract = {Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies each with the potential for altering how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous for pattern recognition, with support vector machines ({SVMs}) being the most well-known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element to computational speed-ups afforded by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here, we propose and experimentally implement two novel methods on a superconducting processor. Both methods represent the feature space of a classification problem by a quantum state, taking advantage of the large dimensionality of quantum Hilbert space to obtain an enhanced solution. One method, the quantum variational classifier builds on [1,2] and operates through using a variational quantum circuit to classify a training set in direct analogy to conventional {SVMs}. In the second, a quantum kernel estimator, we estimate the kernel function and optimize the classifier directly. The two methods present a new class of tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate scale quantum computers [3] to machine learning.},

	abstract = {We study the robustness of the bucket brigade quantum random access memory model introduced by Giovannetti, Lloyd, and Maccone [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 160501 (2008)]. Due to a result of Regev and Schiff [{ICALP} '08 pp. 773], we show that for a class of error models the error rate per gate in the bucket brigade quantum memory has to be of order \$o(2{\textasciicircum}\{-n/2\})\$ (where \$N=2{\textasciicircum}n\$ is the size of the memory) whenever the memory is used as an oracle for the quantum searching problem. We conjecture that this is the case for any realistic error model that will be encountered in practice, and that for algorithms with super-polynomially many oracle queries the error rate must be super-polynomially small, which further motivates the need for quantum error correction. By contrast, for algorithms such as matrix inversion [Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 150502 (2009)] or quantum machine learning [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 130503 (2014)] that only require a polynomial number of queries, the error rate only needs to be polynomially small and quantum error correction may not be required. We introduce a circuit model for the quantum bucket brigade architecture and argue that quantum error correction for the circuit causes the quantum bucket brigade architecture to lose its primary advantage of a small number of "active" gates, since all components have to be actively error corrected.},

I review deep supervised learning (also recapitulating the history of backpropagation), unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning \& evolutionary computation, and indirect search for short programs encoding deep and large networks.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06002},
	abstract = {We introduce a quantum neural network, {QNN}, that can represent labeled data, classical or quantum, and be trained by supervised learning. The quantum circuit consists of a sequence of parameter dependent unitary transformations which acts on an input quantum state. For binary classification a single Pauli operator is measured on a designated readout qubit. The measured output is the quantum neural network's predictor of the binary label of the input state. First we look at classifying classical data sets which consist of n-bit strings with binary labels. The input quantum state is an n-bit computational basis state corresponding to a sample string. We show how to design a circuit made from two qubit unitaries that can correctly represent the label of any Boolean function of n bits. For certain label functions the circuit is exponentially long. We introduce parameter dependent unitaries that can be adapted by supervised learning of labeled data. We study an example of real world data consisting of downsampled images of handwritten digits each of which has been labeled as one of two distinct digits. We show through classical simulation that parameters can be found that allow the {QNN} to learn to correctly distinguish the two data sets. We then discuss presenting the data as quantum superpositions of computational basis states corresponding to different label values. Here we show through simulation that learning is possible. We consider using our {QNN} to learn the label of a general quantum state. By example we show that this can be done. Our work is exploratory and relies on the classical simulation of small quantum systems. The {QNN} proposed here was designed with near-term quantum processors in mind. Therefore it will be possible to run this {QNN} on a near term gate model quantum computer where its power can be explored beyond what can be explored with simulation.},

	abstract = {Quantum mechanics fundamentally forbids deterministic discrimination of quantum states and processes. However, the ability to optimally distinguish various classes of quantum data is an important primitive in quantum information science. In this work, we train near-term quantum circuits to classify data represented by non-orthogonal quantum probability distributions using the Adam stochastic optimization algorithm. This is achieved by iterative interactions of a classical device with a quantum processor to discover the parameters of an unknown non-unitary quantum circuit. This circuit learns to simulates the unknown structure of a generalized quantum measurement, or Positive-Operator-Value-Measure ({POVM}), that is required to optimally distinguish possible distributions of quantum inputs. Notably we use universal circuit topologies, with a theoretically motivated circuit design, which guarantees that our circuits can in principle learn to perform arbitrary input-output mappings. Our numerical simulations show that shallow quantum circuits could be trained to discriminate among various pure and mixed quantum states exhibiting a trade-off between minimizing erroneous and inconclusive outcomes with comparable performance to theoretically optimal {POVMs}. We train the circuit on different classes of quantum data and evaluate the generalization error on unseen mixed quantum states. This generalization power hence distinguishes our work from standard circuit optimization and provides an example of quantum machine learning for a task that has inherently no classical analogue.},

We explore how properties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry, locality, compositionality, and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally simple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to the renormalization group. We prove various "no-flattening theorems" showing when efficient linear deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss, for example, we show that \$n\$ variables cannot be multiplied using fewer than 2{\textasciicircum}n neurons in a single hidden layer.},

Focusing on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass as an example, we find a system-size independent distribution of the duration of pulses, with characteristic time scale set by the inverse of the coupling constants in the Hamiltonian. The optimality of the bang-bang protocols and the characteristic time scale of the pulses provide an efficient parameterization of the protocol and inform the search for effective hybrid (classical and quantum) schemes for tackling combinatorial optimization problems. For the particular systems we study, we find numerically that the optimal nonadiabatic bang-bang protocols outperform conventional quantum annealing in the presence of weak white additive external noise and weak coupling to a thermal bath modeled with the Redfield master equation.},

Before the full power of such machines will be available, near-term quantum devices will provide several hundred qubits and limited error correction. Still, there is a realistic prospect to run useful algorithms within the limited circuit depth of such devices. Particularly promising are optimization algorithms that follow a hybrid approach: the aim is to steer a highly entangled state on a quantum system to a target state that minimizes a cost function via variation of some gate parameters. This variational approach can be used both for classical optimization problems as well as for problems in quantum chemistry. The challenge is to converge to the target state given the limited coherence time and connectivity of the qubits. In this context, the quantum volume as a metric to compare the power of near-term quantum devices is discussed. With focus on chemistry applications, a general description of variational algorithms is provided and the mapping from fermions to qubits is explained. Coupled-cluster and heuristic trial wave-functions are considered for efficiently finding molecular ground states. Furthermore, simple error-mitigation schemes are introduced that could improve the accuracy of determining ground-state energies. Advancing these techniques may lead to near-term demonstrations of useful quantum computation with systems containing several hundred qubits.},

A complete assessment of scalability and competitiveness of {VQA} should take into account both the quality and the time of dynamics optimization. The method of optimal stopping, employed here, provides such an assessment by explicitly including time as a cost factor. Here we showcase this measure for benchmarking {VQA} as a solver for some quadratic unconstrained binary optimization. Moreover we show that a better choice for the cost function of the classical routine can significantly improve the performance of the {VQA} algorithm and even improving it's scaling properties.},

We give several examples of such nonlocal games where strategies that make use of entanglement outperform all possible classical strategies. One implication of these examples is that entanglement can profoundly affect the soundness property of two-prover interactive proof systems. We then establish limits on the probability with which strategies making use of entanglement can win restricted types of nonlocal games. These upper bounds may be regarded as generalizations of Tsirelson-type inequalities, which place bounds on the extent to which quantum information can allow for the violation of Bell inequalities. We also investigate the amount of entanglement required by optimal and nearly optimal quantum strategies for some games.},

The leading candidate task for this quantum computational supremacy milestone entails sampling from the output distribution defined by a random quantum circuit. We perform this task on conventional computers for larger circuits than in previous results, by trading circuit fidelity for computational resources to match the fidelity of a given quantum computer. By using publicly available Google Cloud Computing, we can price such simulations and enable comparisons by total cost across multiple hardware types. We simulate approximate sampling from the output of a circuit with 7 x 8 qubits and depth 1+40+1 by producing one million bitstring probabilitites with fidelity 0.5\%, at an estimated cost of {\textbackslash}\$35184. The simulation costs scale linearly with fidelity. We estimate the cost of approximate sampling 7 x 7 qubits at depth 1+48+1 and fidelity 0.5\% to be one million dollars. Approximate sampling would take seconds on a quantum computer. We pay particular attention to validating simulation results. Finally, we explain why recently refined benchmarks substantially increase computation cost of leading simulators, halving the circuit depth that can be simulated within the same time.},

We use a continuous-variable quantum neural network as the circuit architecture. The network is composed of several layers of optical gates with variable parameters that are optimized by applying automatic differentiation using the {TensorFlow} backend of the Strawberry Fields photonic quantum computer simulator. We demonstrate the power and versatility of our methods by learning how to use short-depth circuits to synthesize single photons, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, {NOON} states, cubic phase gates, random unitaries, cross-Kerr interactions, as well as several other states and gates. We routinely obtain high fidelities above 99{\textbackslash}\% using short-depth circuits, typically consisting of a few hundred gates.

	abstract = {The simulation of molecules is a widely anticipated application of quantum computers. However, recent studies {\textbackslash}cite\{{WBCH}13a,{HWBT}14a\} have cast a shadow on this hope by revealing that the complexity in gate count of such simulations increases with the number of spin orbitals \$N\$ as \$N{\textasciicircum}8\$, which becomes prohibitive even for molecules of modest size \$N{\textbackslash}sim 100\$. This study was partly based on a scaling analysis of the Trotter step required for an ensemble of random artificial molecules. Here, we revisit this analysis and find instead that the scaling is closer to \$N{\textasciicircum}6\$ in worst case for real model molecules we have studied, indicating that the random ensemble fails to accurately capture the statistical properties of real-world molecules. Actual scaling may be significantly better than this due to averaging effects. We then present an alternative simulation scheme and show that it can sometimes outperform existing schemes, but that this possibility depends crucially on the details of the simulated molecule. We obtain further improvements using a version of the coalescing scheme of {\textbackslash}cite\{{WBCH}13a\}; this scheme is based on using different Trotter steps for different terms. The method we use to bound the complexity of simulating a given molecule is efficient, in contrast to the approach of {\textbackslash}cite\{{WBCH}13a,{HWBT}14a\} which relied on exponentially costly classical exact simulation.},

	abstract = {The local Hamiltonian problem consists of estimating the ground-state energy (given by the minimum eigenvalue) of a local quantum Hamiltonian. First, we show the existence of a good product-state approximation for the ground-state energy of 2-local Hamiltonians with one or more of the following properties: (1) high degree, (2) small expansion, or (3) a ground state with sublinear entanglement with respect to some partition into small pieces. The approximation based on degree is a surprising difference between quantum Hamiltonians and classical {CSPs} (constraint satisfaction problems), since in the classical setting, higher degree is usually associated with harder {CSPs}. The approximation based on low entanglement, in turn, was previously known only in the regime where the entanglement was close to zero. Since the existence of a low-energy product state can be checked in {NP}, the result implies that any Hamiltonian used for a quantum {PCP} theorem should have: (1) constant degree, (2) constant expansion, (3) a "volume law" for entanglement with respect to any partition into small parts. Second, we show that in several cases, good product-state approximations not only exist, but can be found in polynomial time: (1) 2-local Hamiltonians on any planar graph, solving an open problem of Bansal, Bravyi, and Terhal, (2) dense k-local Hamiltonians for any constant k, solving an open problem of Gharibian and Kempe, and (3) 2-local Hamiltonians on graphs with low threshold rank, via a quantum generalization of a recent result of Barak, Raghavendra and Steurer. Our work introduces two new tools which may be of independent interest. First, we prove a new quantum version of the de Finetti theorem which does not require the usual assumption of symmetry. Second, we describe a way to analyze the application of the Lasserre/Parrilo {SDP} hierarchy to local quantum Hamiltonians.},

	abstract = {As quantum computers improve in the number of qubits and fidelity, the question of when they surpass state-of-the-art classical computation for a well-defined computational task is attracting much attention. The leading candidate task for this quantum computational supremacy milestone entails sampling from the output distribution defined by a random quantum circuit. We perform this task on conventional computers for larger circuits than in previous results, by trading circuit fidelity for computational resources to match the fidelity of a given quantum computer. By using publicly available Google Cloud Computing, we can price such simulations and enable comparisons by total cost across multiple hardware types. We simulate approximate sampling from the output of a circuit with 7 x 8 qubits and depth 1+40+1 by producing one million bitstring probabilities with fidelity 0.5\%, at an estimated cost of \$35184. The simulation costs scale linearly with fidelity. We estimate the cost of approximate sampling 7 x 7 qubits at depth 1+48+1 and fidelity 0.5\% to be one million dollars. Approximate sampling would take seconds on a quantum computer. We pay particular attention to validating simulation results. Finally, we explain why recently refined benchmarks substantially increase computation cost of leading simulators, halving the circuit depth that can be simulated within the same time.},

	title = {Practical optimization for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01450},
	abstract = {A novel class of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms based on the variational approach have recently emerged from separate proposals addressing, for example, quantum chemistry and combinatorial problems. These algorithms provide an approximate solution to the problem at hand by encoding it in the state of a quantum computer. The operations used to prepare the state are not a priori fixed but, quite the opposite, are subjected to a classical optimization procedure that modifies the quantum gates and improves the quality of the approximate solution. While the quantum hardware determines the size of the problem and what states are achievable (limited, respectively, by the number of qubits and by the kind and number of possible quantum gates), it is the classical optimization procedure that determines the way in which the quantum states are explored and whether the best available solution is actually reached. In addition, the quantities required in the optimization, for example the objective function itself, have to be estimated with finite precision in any experimental implementation. While it is desirable to have very precise estimates, this comes at the cost of repeating the state preparation and measurement multiple times. Here we analyze the competing requirements of high precision and low number of repetitions and study how the overall performance of the variational algorithm is affected by the precision level and the choice of the optimization method. Finally, this study introduces quasi-Newton optimization methods in the general context of hybrid variational algorithms and presents quantitative results for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm.},

Here, we introduce a {\textbackslash}emph\{quantum variational autoencoder\} ({QVAE}): a {VAE} whose latent generative process is implemented as a quantum Boltzmann machine ({QBM}). We show that our model can be trained end-to-end by maximizing a well-defined loss-function: a "quantum" lower-bound to a variational approximation of the log-likelihood. We use quantum Monte Carlo ({QMC}) simulations to train and evaluate the performance of {QVAEs}. To achieve the best performance, we first create a {VAE} platform with discrete latent space generated by a restricted Boltzmann machine ({RBM}). Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the {MNIST} dataset when compared against similar approaches that only involve discrete variables in the generative process. We consider {QVAEs} with a smaller number of latent units to be able to perform {QMC} simulations, which are computationally expensive. We show that {QVAEs} can be trained effectively in regimes where quantum effects are relevant despite training via the quantum bound. Our findings open the way to the use of quantum computers to train {QVAEs} to achieve competitive performance for generative models. Placing a {QBM} in the latent space of a {VAE} leverages the full potential of current and next-generation quantum computers as sampling devices.},

	abstract = {Compiling quantum algorithms for near-term quantum computers (accounting for connectivity and native gate alphabets) is a major challenge that has received significant attention both by industry and academia. Avoiding the exponential overhead of classical simulation of quantum dynamics will allow compilation of larger algorithms, and a strategy for this is to evaluate an algorithm's cost on a quantum computer. To this end, we propose quantum-assisted quantum compiling ({QAQC}). In {QAQC}, we use the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product between a target unitary \$U\$ and a trainable unitary \$V\$ as the cost function to be evaluated on the quantum computer. We introduce two circuits for evaluating this cost. One circuit computes \${\textbar}\{{\textbackslash}rm Tr\} (V{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}dagger U){\textbar}\$, and we use this circuit for gradient-free compiling. Our other circuit gives \$\{{\textbackslash}rm Tr\}(V{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}dagger U)\$ and is a generalization of the Power of One Qubit that we call the Power of Two Qubits. We use this circuit for gradient-based compiling. As a demonstration of {QAQC}, we compile various one-qubit gates on {IBM}'s and Rigetti's quantum computers into their respective native gate alphabets. Future applications of {QAQC} include algorithm depth compression, black-box compiling, noise mitigation, and benchmarking.},

We use a continuous-variable quantum neural network as the circuit architecture. The network is composed of several layers of optical gates with variable parameters that are optimized by applying automatic differentiation using the {TensorFlow} backend of the Strawberry Fields photonic quantum computer simulator. We demonstrate the power and versatility of our methods by learning how to use short-depth circuits to synthesize single photons, Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states, {NOON} states, cubic phase gates, random unitaries, cross-Kerr interactions, as well as several other states and gates. We routinely obtain high fidelities above 99{\textbackslash}\% using short-depth circuits, typically consisting of a few hundred gates.
