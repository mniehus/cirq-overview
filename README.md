The notebook can also be viewed as a static webpage at [this link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rmlarose/cirq-overview/blob/master/article/notebook/cirq.ipynb) using [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

# Notebook Version

The notebook version of the article is hosted in this GitHub repository.

## Online Version Using Binder

Execute the notebook online at [this link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rmlarose/cirq-overview/master?filepath=article%2Fnotebook%2Fcirq.ipynb
) using [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), an cloud platform for interactively executing Jupyter notebooks. Here, be sure to uncomment the lines in the notebook for installing Cirq since it's not natively installed on Binder.

## Local Version Using Jupyter
