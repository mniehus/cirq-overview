    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> In July 2018, the <a href=\"https://quantumcomputingreport.com\">Quantum Computing Report</a> published an <a href=\"https://quantumcomputingreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Overview-and-Comparison-of-Gate-Level-Quantum-Software-Platforms-Final-June-21-2018.pdf\">in-depth analysis of four major gate-model quantum software platforms</a>: pyQuil by Rigetti, QISKit by IBM, ProjectQ by ETH Zurich, and the Quantum Developer Kit by Microsoft. Shortly after, Google announced the release of their own quantum software platform: Cirq. In this paper, we provide an overview and comparative analysis of this newly-released software in reference to the previously-reviewed quantum software platforms. Our analysis proceeds similarly by covering language syntax through example programs, library support, quantum simulators, and quantum computer capabilities. We additionally cover more advanced features of the software including the strong support for variational quantum algorithms and near-term quantum computing. </p> "

    "Quantum computing is transitioning from a theoretical to practical phase. Historically, researchers have asked questions about the possibilities of speedups through black-box access to abstract, idealized quantum computers. Recently, small, imperfect quantum computers have been fabricated and made available over the cloud. A significant body of literature is emerging as researchers use these devices to solve problems in nuclear physics [Nuc Phys Paper], quantum chemistry [VQE], condensed matter [VQSD], optimization [QAOA], number theory [VQF], graph theory [QAOA on MAXCUT], and even quantum computing itself [QAQC et al.]. While these problems are small and easily handled by conventional computers, the prospect of large-scale quantum computers could quickly change this. Even on current quantum computers, certain contrived problems may soon demonstrate \"quantum supremacy\" [Quant Suprem Paper], an exciting landmark in the history of computation. \n",

    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> \n",
    "This theoretical-to-practical progression of the field necessitates access to quantum computers that is much different from black box access on pen and paper. Many institutions in industry and academia have recognized this and began building tools for this purpose, and a slew of startup companies has emerged to fill the gaps in the transition to practical quantum computing. The following diagram represents a snapshot of this rapidly evolving landscape:\n",

    "For most \"full-stack\" quantum computing companies, access to quantum computers is granted over the cloud, and the interaction between research scientists and quantum computers is mediated by a software platform with API access. To an outside observer, this interaction does not warrant much thought: it just needs to allow users to implement quantum gates on qubits. However, many practical considerations emerge when using a software interface to communicate with a real or simulated quantum computer. Among these are the following:\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What gate operations are natively built-in?\n",
    "1. Can a gate that's not native be implemented into a quantum algorithm? How difficult is it to do this?\n",
    "1. How many quantum computers does the platform give access to?\n",
    "1. Is compilation handled automatically by the software? And to what degree of optimality?\n",
    "1. How do job requests to quantum computers get handled? In a queue, dedicated time?\n",
    "1. What quantum computer simulators can be used to test algorithms? How many qubits can be simulated? Is the simulator noisy or noiseless?\n",
    "1. Does every quantum algorithm have to be programmed manually? Or are some common subroutines built-in?\n",
    "1. What _classical_ programming language is the software written in?\n",
    "1. How easy is it to create, work with, and manipulate quantum circuits?\n",
    "1. How easy is it to parametrize algorithms for near-term quantum computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> \n",
    "Each of these considerations is important from a practical perspective. For example, an algorithm on many qubits may be better implemented on a software platform with a more high-performance simulator; an algorithm with many gates may be better for a platform with higher fidelity qubits; an algorithm with many non-standard gates may be better for a platform with an optimal compiler. Other considerations such as examples, tutorials, and documentation are equally important as they help bring in new users and answer questions of experienced users.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"> \n",
    "For these reasons, it is both valid and important to evaluate quantum software platforms as more than the simple interface they may appear to be. To this end, the Quantum Computing Report published an article comparing Forest by Rigetti, QISKit by IBM, ProjectQ by ETH Zurich, and the Quantum Developer Kit by Microsoft. Each platform was found to have different strengths and different emphases that determined the set of problems best-suited for the environment. The purpose of this article is to introduce and analyze Cirq in a similar fashion.\n",

    "To this end, the rest of the article is organized as follows. After briefly commenting on the format of this article, we cover installation, documentation, language syntax, and quantum computer/simulator support in Cirq. We then transition into more advanced features like circuit manipulation and optimization. Lastly, we conclude with an example of a variational quantum algorithm to demonstrate the near-term capabilities of Cirq. Throughout, we refer back to previously covered software platforms to maintain the comparative analysis in our previous installation.\n",
